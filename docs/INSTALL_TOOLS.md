# 🗒️ Installing tools

You need virtualization packages, Ansible and OpenTofu on your host machine to install my homelab.  
To do so, run the following commands:
```bash
chmod +x ./install_complete.sh
sudo ./install_complete.sh
```

You need sudo privileges to run the install script as it uses your package manager.  
Currently works on Debian and RHEL based distributions.
