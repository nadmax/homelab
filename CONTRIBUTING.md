# Contributing
First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute.  
Your involvement is deeply appreciated and helps improve the project.  

Before you get started, please read the following [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines).

## Contribution Guidelines
To maintain a clean, consistent, and maintainable codebase, all contributors are expected to follow these rules:

- **Code must be written in English**  
All variable names, function names, and other identifiers must be in English to ensure clarity and consistency across the codebase.

- **Commits must start with a verb**  
Use imperative, present-tense verbs in commit messages ("Add license", "Update README").

- **Comments are not allowed, except for installation scripts**  
Avoid inline or block comments in the code unless they are strictly necessary for describing installation processes or scripts.

- **TODOs are forbidden**  
Do not leave TODO markers in the code.  
Any incomplete features or tasks should be tracked using issues, not comments in the codebase.
