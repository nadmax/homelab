# Homelab
The aim of this project is to create a local Kubernetes cluster that can be replicated on your premises.  
It is built with automation and scalability in mind.  
Perfect for learning, testing, and tinkering.  

## Overview
The architecture consists of **three virtual machines** orchestrated into a Kubernetes cluster.  
Each VM is provisioned, configured, and container-ready with Docker and Kubernetes.

**Tech Stack:**
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/): Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to define and deploy VMs  
- [Cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Associated with OpenTofu to define VMs users and metadatas
- [libvirt](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dmacvicar/libvirt/latest/docs):  Local virtual machine management  
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html): Automates k8s cluster setup and configuration tasks  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Container runtime for workloads  
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/): Container orchestration for deploying and managing applications
