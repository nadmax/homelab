# homelab
## Concept
The goal is to automate 3 locals VM (called workers).   

## Coming soon
Currently, I only use Ansible to create and delete a file in remote hosts. (more concrete tasks will be defined)  
I plan to use:  
- Podman (will try it instead of Docker)
- Kubernetes (or k3s)  
- Zabbix  
- Helm
